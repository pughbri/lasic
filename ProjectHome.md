LASIC is a language that facilitates creating and managing systems in a cloud environment. It allows you to create scripts that describe a system, its components, and the relationship between those components using a declarative syntax. Various verbs can then be applied to the script such as deploy (create a new system), shutdown, or runAction(run some action on components of the system). LASIC currently supports Amazon's cloud environment (AWS). LASIC stands for Language for Automating Systems in the Cloud.
